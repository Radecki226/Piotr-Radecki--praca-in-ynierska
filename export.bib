   abstract = {The general problem of processing the signals received on an array of sensors for the location of the emitter, in the general case, considers sensors with arbitrary locations and arbitrary directional characteristics (gain/phase/polarization) in a noise/interference environment of arbitrary covariance matrix. The multiple emitter aspect of this problem and the generality of the solution are considered. A description is given of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of 1) number of incident wavefronts present; 2) directions of arrival (or emitter locations); 3) strengths and cross correlations among the incident waveforms; and 4) noise/interference strength. Examples and comparisons with methods based on maximum likelihood and maximum entropy, as well as conventional beamforming, are included. An example of MUSIC's use as a multiple frequency estimator operating on time series is included.},

@article{Braun2014,
   abstract = {When capturing speech in a multi-talker telecommunication scenario, it is desirable to keep the enhanced signal at an equal loudness level for each speaker. Single-channel automatic gain control systems are not able to adjust the level of different talkers when they are simultaneously active. In this work, an automatic spatial gain control (ASGC) algorithm is proposed that adjusts the directional response of an existing informed spatial filter such that the direct sound of multiple sources can be kept at a constant desired loudness level at the output. The spatial filter additionally reduces diffuse sound and ambient noise. It is shown that the proposed AGSC works well within the tested scenario, and is able to adjust the levels of different speakers even during double talk scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Extracting sound sources in noisy and reverberant conditions remains a challenging task that is commonly found in modern communication systems. In this work, we consider the problem of obtaining a desired spatial response for at most L simultaneously active sound sources. The proposed spatial filter is obtained by minimizing the diffuse plus self-noise power at the output of the filter subject to L linear constraints. In contrast to earlier works, the L constraints are based on instantaneous narrowband direction-of-arrival estimates. In addition, a novel estimator for the diffuse-to-noise ratio is developed that exhibits a sufficiently high temporal and spectral resolution to achieve both dereverberation and noise reduction. The presented results demonstrate that an optimal tradeoff between maximum white noise gain and maximum directivity is achieved. © 2013 IEEE.},
